## Family Clips

Video tutorial [can be found here](https://youtu.be/FXTLazKDjzA).

Let's build a new, FUN app with Flutter. 

"Family Clips" is a simple Flutter app that displays each member of your family in a grid, and when you click on a family member it plays a variety of audio clips from them. My kids found this hilarious. 

In this video/repo, we'll build this app using the McCallister family, from Home Alone, to demonstrate functionality. 

You will:
- Learn basic Flutter / Dart concepts and layouts
- Learn how to generate random numbers/images using the Dart Math package
- Learn how to load and play audio clips using the audioplayers library
- Have a fun app to share with your spouse, family, or friends. Add anyone you want to it!!
